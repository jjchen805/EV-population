# WA Electric Vehicles Report
The primary goal of this analysis is to support urban planning departments and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers in identifying areas with high EV adoption rates to inform decisions on infrastructure development and targeted marketing efforts. By analyzing the distribution of EVs across cities and counties, as well as key factors such as the percentage of EVs relative to the population, the most popular EV models, and best-performing ranges, stakeholders can strategically allocate resources. Urban planners can use this data to prioritize the construction of charging stations, service centers, and other EV-related infrastructure in areas with growing demand. At the same time, EV manufacturers can leverage these insights to refine marketing strategies, focusing on cities or counties with the highest adoption rates, while also tailoring product offerings to meet consumer preferences in these regions.
